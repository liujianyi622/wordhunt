Problems

1. When we run the application on the phone, after several operations, the application will stop, then it will jump to the previous page.
If we continue, we don't have the problems anymore. But Android Studio doesn't show any error in the console.
We think, this problem may because the background picture or the cache of the application.

2. Is there any standard of the drawable(size of the pictures etc)?
